# simplePathWriter

A big name for a small program. I got sick of creating paths in <inkscape>(http://www.inkscape.org)
so I wrote this. The great advantage is that if you get it wrong (you will) it only takes a 
moment to edit the text file, run the program and see the results. The only paths produced are line 
segments (hence *simple*PathWriter), no fancy splines or anything.

The file list here is inadequate. If you're having problems running or building this 
software download the 
[zip file](https://github.com/njamescouk/simplePathWriter/releases/download/v1.0/simplePathWriter_1.0.zip), 
 which contains binaries needed for windows.
